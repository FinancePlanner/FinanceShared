],
targets: [
    .executableTarget(
        name: "StockPlanBackend",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "StockPlanShared", package: "StockPlanShared"),
        ]
    )
]
```

### iOS app (Xcode)

1. File > Add Packages...
2. Add `https://github.com/<your-org>/StockPlanShared.git`
3. Add product `StockPlanShared` to your app target

## Versioning

Use semantic versioning and tags:
- `0.x` while contracts are still evolving
- `1.0.0` when contracts are stable

For breaking API changes, release a new major version and update backend + iOS together.
